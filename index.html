      <p>On March 24 of 1989, the Exxon Valdez, an oil ship which was carrying 53 million gallons of crude oil crossed along the Prince William Sound in Alaska. The captain was drunk, and ran aground, which broke 8 cargo tanks and released around 11 million gallons of crude oil into the Prince William Sound. It was the largest oil spill in US history, and it was in a very untouched part of alaska where not much human intervention had taken place. The cleanup process took a very long time, and there is still lasting damage to the wildlife of the area.

      <p>The Exxon Valdez oil spill was one of the biggest oil spills in history, both in magnitude and its reach. As catastrophic and destructive as it was, it has been very useful to motivate change in governmental oversight involving keeping the environment clean and not interfering, as well as being a big example of the consequences of recklessness and disregard for the environment, and having people be more aware of why environmental neglect is bad.

      <h1 class="bt" style="top: 200px">Control 1: The oil spill was a catastrophic event that caused a lot of issues for both the area of effect and the company responsible for what happened.</h1>
      <p><strong>Evidence</strong> : the very large spill size, the remote location, and the character of the oil all tested spill preparedness and response capabilities.
        <br><br><strong>Explanation</strong> : The circumstances by which the spill occurred were very challenging to be able to resolve. It was far away from any large fleets of response teams, and the amount of oil was immense. This would greatly affect the efforts required to clean the spill </p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>Evidence </strong>: Thousands of workers and volunteers helped to clean up after the oil spill, and Exxon provided $2.1 billion in funding.
        <br><br><strong>Explanation</strong>strong> : This shows how much the spill impacted the environment. The workers worked on fixing the damage caused for years, and the company funded 2.1 Billion. This shows how the damage of one mistake can cause a massive issue for many people, and shows how it hurt exxon as well.

      <h1 class="bt" style="top: 200px">Control 2: The oil spill increased public awareness of the environment.</h1>
      <p><strong>Evidence</strong> : “It makes me very sad because my class is doing a report on sea otters. And sea otters are cute. Sea otters are an endangered species. Please clean up the oil spill.”
        <br><br><strong>Explanation</strong> : This evidence shows that the information about the Exxon Valdez oil spill reached a lot of the public, and that those who heard about it were upset with the situation, and wanted the oil gone. It shows how people want bad things to stop happening, and that when they find bad, they will fight to get rid of it. </p>

      <p><strong>Evidence </strong>: "Exxon Valdez made visible the immediate environmental risks associated with fossil fuel extraction. Today, decades later, the long-term climate impacts from decades of fossil fuel extraction have gained center stage as the issue becomes a more pressing — and visible — concern.”
        <br><br><strong>Explanation</strong> : The evidence explains how the reaction to the oil spill is in a lot of ways paralleled to the way that people of today are limiting climate change. This shows that those from the Exxon days are still able to tell those after them that the environment is an important thing, and that our generation has in a way listened.

      <h1 class="bt" style="top: 200px">Control 3: The oil spill Changed how the government focused on environmental safety as a whole</h1>
      <p><strong>Evidence</strong> : The President has asked the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator to coordinate long-range planning to restore the environment of Prince William Sound.

        <br><br><strong>Explanation</strong> : The quote shows how the president ands the EPA were active in trying to make a cleanup effort happen, and shows planning being done for the future of the spill site. </p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>Evidence </strong>: ”After the spill, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 mandated the formation of a Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council, funded by the oil industry.”        <br><br><strong>Explanation</strong>strong> : Shows how the government responded to the oil spill with legislation to help reduce such events from occurring in the future. This is a direct example of the government reacting to the spill, and trying to prevent it from happening again
